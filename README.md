# AsteroidsGame
The end-of-unit project for my python course, a recreation of the classic arcade game: Asteroids

Now that you’ve had some practice with classes, you’re going to build a game that uses them in a more complex way. For your final project of the course, you will be building your first program outside of the terminal. You will still run the project from the terminal, but it will be displayed on an external window that will allow you to use images rather than just keyboard characters. The game you will be creating is a version of the classic arcade game, asteroids. If you haven’t played asteroids, it’s pretty simple: you control a spaceship and shoot at asteroids and enemy ships until you get hit. In our version, we’ll anchor the ship to the bottom of the screen and have asteroids and enemies advance towards us.

In order to build this game outside of the terminal, we’ll be using an API called arcade, which makes it relatively easy to use visuals, use the arrow keys, and more.
